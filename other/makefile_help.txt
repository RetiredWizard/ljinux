Ljinux Makefile

Usage:

    <target> [debug]

Targets:

    install     Install ljinux (along with all the needed dependecies to boot) on the board.
    kernel      Install the ljinux kernel onto the board. This as by itself will not boot.
    debug       Install the ljinux kernel onto the board, but doesn't optimise it. This
                 option should only be used for kernel development.
    help        Displays this help screen.
                
    wifi        Installs the ljinux kernel module driver_wifi onto the board.
                 This module allows you to use ljinux along with the built-in circuitpython
                 wifi module. Accepts "debug" as an argument.
    w5500spi    Installs the ljinux kernel module driver_w5500spi onto the board.
                 This module allows you to use ljinux along with a w5500 (spi interface)
                 device. Accepts "debug" as an argument.
                
    ccon        Install CircuitPythonConnect to your system. It will be available as "ccon".
    connection  Run a board connection without installing ccon.

To create a installation folder in the source directory for use with wifi/ble-only boards, use:
    
    no_install=<INSERT BOARD NAME HERE> install
    
This will create a folder in within source, that contains all the files needed.
You can upload these over the workflow of your choice.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not run with -j > 1
