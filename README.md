# ljinux
A "linux" written in üÖ±Ô∏èython, for the pi pico.

Disclaimer: 

Do not take this project seriously. Code contains UwU's and Awooo's.
I know it's not a linux, or an os, or anything in that regard, but.. making it look like one, makes it funnier.

Also, it's wip.

<h3>Anyways, since you are still reading let's start with the basics.</h3>
It runs on the rpi pico, circuitpython.
As for the display I use a SSD1306 over I2C, it's optional tho.

It's basics:
there are no basics, this project is a dumpster fire.

It's shell which is named <b>based</b>, is the only programming language it has.
You can execute commands over serial to it, or by feeding them from a Init.lja

<h2>Installation to a fresh pi pico:</h2>

Install Circuitpython version 7.x,  
copy over the display library to /lib along with the framebuf library,  
and unzip this repo onto the CIRCUITPY drive

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: unless the GP0 and GP1 pins are connected the drive will no longer appear after a powercycle.</b>

based commands:
