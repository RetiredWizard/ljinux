# Beryllium OS
A unix-like operating system for CircuitPython powered microcontrollers.  <a href="https://github.com/psf/black"><img alt="Code style: black" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg"></a><br />
(Formerly known as ljinux)<br />

<b>Important notes:</b><br />
This project is still <b>in it's early developement</b>!<br />
The kernel API is undergoing massive breaking changes every day.<br />
This project is <b>NOT</b> a linux distribution.<br />
This project is <b>NOT</b> compatible with any linux code / binaries.<br />

<b><i>We also now have a [discord](https://discord.gg/V8AejwGpCv) server!<br />
If you need support or want to hang out, feel free to join in!</i></b><br />

We also work with [Github Discussions](https://github.com/beryllium-org/OS/discussions).<br />

## Prerequisites and hardware support

Runs on CircuitPython <code>9.0.X</code>.<br />
Currently the supported boards are:<br />

Espressif:<br />
 - Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2<br />
 - Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 TFT<br />
 - DFRobot Beetle ESP32-C3<br />
 - Firebeetle 2 ESP32-S3<br />
 - M5Stack Timer Camera X<br />
 - Wemos Lolin S2 Mini<br />
 - WeAct ESP32-C6<br />
 - Waveshare ESP32-S2-Pico<br />

Raspberry Pi:<br />
 - Adafruit KB2040<br />
 - Pimoroni Pico Lipo (16mb)<br />
 - Pimoroni Pico Lipo (4mb)<br />
 - Raspberry Pi Pico<br />
 - Raspberry Pi Pico W<br />
 - Waveshare RP2040-Zero<br />

Nordic:<br />
 - Seeed XIAO nRF52840 (Sense)<br />

SAMD:<br />
 - Seeed Wio Terminal<br />

<br />
But it can probably run on many more.<br />
<br />
The currently stable supported MCUs are: <code>ESP32</code>, <code>ESP32-S2</code>, <code>ESP32-S3</code>, <code>ESP32-C3</code>, <code>ESP32-C6</code>, <code>RP2040</code>, <code>nRF52840</code>, <code>SAMD51</code>.<br />
The currently unsupported CircuitPython-compatible MCU families / CircuitPython platforms are: <code>SAMD21</code>, <code>litex</code>, <code>mimxrt10xx</code>, <code>efr32</code>, <code>stm</code>.<br />
The MCU's that are currently unsupported are so because I either can't get my hands on a decent board with them or they don't have enough ram for it.<br />
<br />
The only real limiting factor should be ram, as about 70k (usable under circuitpython) are needed.<br />
<i>(If you have gotten it running on an unsupported board, feel free to pr)</i><br />

## Installation / Updating

Do note, installation using scripts from windows is unsupported. Use a release <code>.zip</code> instead.<br />
Though, if you are windows user, this project **really** isn't for you.<br />

1) Install a supported CircuitPython version onto the board.<br />
    Detailed instructions regarding CircuitPython can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython).<br />
2) Download the latest Beryllium OS release for your board and extract it onto it.<br />
    <b>Or even better</b>, if you wish to use the latest and greatest, clone this repository and from within the "source" folder, run <code>make install</code> with your board mounted.<br />
    DO NOT run with <code>-j</code>!!!<br />
    This command will automatically update the system files if they already exist.<br />
    To only update the core files, run <code>make kernel</code> instead.<br />
    If you only want to update the board extras, like drivers and packages, run <code>make extras</code> instead.<br />
    If you plan on loading the files remotely (via web/ble workflow), run <code>make BOARD=\*your board.board_id\* install</code> instead.<br />
    The files for you to copy will be created inside <code>source/build_\*your board.board_id\*</code>.<br />
3) *(Optional)* Copy over the packages you wish to install with jpkg, or install drivers with make.<br />
    More info regarding packages in [Packages](#packages)
4) Eject & powercycle the board<br />
    When it's plugged back in, you can connect to it via serial.<br />
    (You can use putty to connect to the board on Windows, Tio or GNU/Screen on Linux or MacOS)<br />
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: To make the board appear again as a usb drive on the host, run the Beryllium command </b><code>devmode</code>.<br />
More info regarding internal commands, available in the manual.<br />

## Packages
Some of beryllium os'es features are not bundled with this install.<br />
You will have to install them seperately through the jpkg package manager.<br />
<br />
You can find beryllium packages in the [jpkg github topic](https://github.com/topics/jpkg).<br />

## Connection

To connect to the board it's recommended to use Putty for Windows and Tio for Linux/MacOS.<br />
A console that works with ANSI escape commands is <b>REQUIRED</b> (aka, not arduino ide).<br /><br />

For Putty, select connection type to be Serial, select the port to be COM<b>X</b> where <b>X</b> is the number of the serial port allocated by the board, and set the speed/baudrate to 115200.<br />
(You can find which com port is allocated from within the Device Manager, it usually is COM3 or COM4)<br /><br />

For Tio if you are on linux, you need to be in the <code>dialout</code> or <code>uucp</code> user group and to connect, run: <code>tio /dev/ttyACM0</code><br />
If you are on a Mac instead, run: <code>ls /dev/tty.usb*</code> to find the device name, and connect to it by running: <code>tio /dev/tty.usb\<Device name here\></code><br />
To disconnect, press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>t</code>, <code>q</code>.<br />
To be added to the <code>dialout</code> group, run <code>sudo usermod -a -G dialout \<your username here\></code> and restart.<br />

## Directory structure

<ul>
<li><code>base</code>, the base root filesystem that will be used to strap all other packages over it.</li>
<li><code>Boardfiles</code>, the different board ports and their configuration data.</li>
<li><code>bootcfg</code>, boot configuration files, to be cherrypicked by ports.</li>
<li><code>drivers</code>, different device drivers that may be build depending on the board.</li>
<li><code>other</code>, miscellaneous files, not used during installation.</li>
<li><code>packages</code>, most of these (if they are compatible with your board) will be bundles with every new installation.</li>
<li><code>scripts</code>, the files needed for compilation, and installation to a board.</li>
<li><code>source</code>, the source files for this project and co. They should be compiled into .mpy files, then into packages.</li>
</ul>
