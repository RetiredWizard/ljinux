All contributions that stick to the core objective of the project (details in issue #10) are more than welcome.
Feel free to create issues even for the smallest of issues or ideas you have about the project. I am more than happy to receive feedback and ideas.
Pr's, however, will be only merged with main, when they run correctly.
Additionally .mpy binaries from pr's will not be pushed into main.
Please keep in mind I am still a beginner and that this project exists for educational & entertainment purposes only.
