All contributions that stick to the core objective of the project (aka making a linux emulator/wanna-be os for the pico) are more than welcome.
Feel free to create issues even for the smallest of issues or ideas you have about the project. I am more than happy to receive feedback and ideas.
Pr's that simply rebase the code are also welcome, however, they will be only merged with main, when they run correctly.
Please keep in mind I am still a beginner and that this project exists for entertainment purposes only.
